// we will use binary search to make the process faster.
//Binary Search is defined as a searching algorithm used in a sorted array by repeatedly dividing the search interval in half.
//The idea of binary search is to use the information that the array is sorted and reduce the time complexity to O(log N).
// If we take an array of 1 crore numbers. to solve this
// In linearsearch - the worst case could be 1 crore steps
// In binarysearch - the worst case could be log2(10000000) = 20 steps approximately
